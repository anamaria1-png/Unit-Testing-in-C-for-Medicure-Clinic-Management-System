The Importance of Unit Testing in Healthcare Systems
In the healthcare industry, reliability is non-negotiable. A clinic management system like Medicure handles sensitive data — patient records, appointment schedules, medical histories, and billing information. Even a minor bug could lead to serious consequences, such as incorrect medical records, missed appointments, or unauthorized access to sensitive data.

This is where unit testing comes in — ensuring that each component of the system works correctly, independently, and consistently. By implementing unit tests with MSTest in C#, we can create a safety net for the Medicure system, catching errors early in the development process and making future updates safer and smoother.
In this section, we’ll dive into the materials needed for a solid foundation in unit testing, especially for complex healthcare applications like Medicure.
The Role of Unit Testing in a Clinic Management System

Unit testing focuses on verifying the smallest testable parts of the application — functions, classes, or modules — independently from the rest of the system. In Medicure, some key areas that require unit testing are:
●	Appointment Management: Ensuring appointment booking prevents overlaps and respects doctor availability.
●	Profile Management: Validating that user profiles are updated correctly without overwriting critical data.
●	Authentication & Authorization: Testing login mechanisms and access control to protect sensitive medical records.
●	Patient Management: Confirming accurate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on patient records.
●	Employee Management: Ensuring employee roles and schedules are correctly handled.
●	Patient History Management: Verifying that medical records are accurately retrieved and updated without data loss.
●	Report Management: Testing report generation logic, ensuring data integrity and proper formatting.
By isolating these features into individual units, MSTest allows developers to build comprehensive test cases that ensure each part of the system performs as expected.
