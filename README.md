🌟 Unit Testing in C# for Medicure Clinic Management System 🌟
The Importance of Unit Testing in Healthcare Systems 🏥
In healthcare, reliability is a must. A clinic management system like Medicure deals with sensitive data — patient records, appointment schedules, medical histories, and billing info. A single bug could cause big problems like inaccurate medical records, missed appointments, or unauthorized access to private data. 😟

That’s where unit testing comes in — making sure each part of the system works correctly, independently, and smoothly. 🛠 By using MSTest in C#, we can create a "safety net" for the Medicure system, catching bugs early on and ensuring that future updates are safer and easier. 🛡

Let’s dive into how we can set up a solid foundation for unit testing, especially for complex healthcare applications like Medicure. 👇

The Role of Unit Testing in a Clinic Management System 🖥
Unit testing focuses on verifying the smallest testable parts of the system — functions, classes, or modules — independently from the rest. In Medicure, here are some key areas that need thorough testing:

Appointment Management 📅: Making sure appointments are booked without overlaps and that doctor availability is respected.

Profile Management 👤: Ensuring user profiles are updated correctly, without losing important data.

Authentication & Authorization 🔑: Testing the login system and access control to protect sensitive medical records.

Patient Management 🏥: Verifying that patient records can be correctly created, read, updated, or deleted (CRUD operations).

Employee Management 👩‍⚕️👨‍⚕️: Ensuring employees' roles and schedules are properly handled.

Patient History Management 🩺: Confirming that medical histories are updated correctly and without data loss.

Report Management 📊: Testing the generation of reports to ensure accuracy and proper formatting.

By isolating these features into individual units, MSTest allows us to build comprehensive tests, ensuring everything works as expected. ✅

- 2/3 implementation corresponds to an intermediate version (beta-beta) of the project, including case studies, comparative assessments, in-depth analyses, etc.
- 3/3 implementation represents the final version of the project, which must include the source code, full documentation, presentation, videos and report on the use of AI.
